But on Kaggle they took over 3 minutes each! Whilst Kaggle's GPUs are less powerful than what I've got at home, that doesn't come close to explaining this vast difference in speed.\n\nI noticed when Kaggle was running that the \"GPU\" indicator in the top right was nearly empty, and the \"CPU\" one was always full. This strongly suggests that the problem was that Kaggle's notebook was CPU bound by decoding and resizing the images. This is a common problem on machines with poor CPU performance -- and indeed Kaggle only provides 2 virtual CPUs at the time of writing.\n\nWe really need to fix this, since we need to be able to iterate much more quickly. What we can do is to simply resize all the images to half their height and width -- which reduces their number of pixels 4x. This should mean an around 4x increase in performance for training small models.\n\nLuckily, fastai has a function which does exactly this, whilst maintaining the folder structure of the data: `resize_images`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"trn_path = Path('sml')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-19T01:47:53.062411Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-19T01:47:53.063075Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-19T01:47:53.072186Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-19T01:47:53.063027Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-19T01:47:53.071065Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"resize_images(path/'train_images', dest=trn_path, max_size=256, recurse=True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-19T01:47:53.459218Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-19T01:47:53.460123Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-19T01:51:16.064755Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-19T01:47:53.460072Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-19T01:51:16.063614Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This will give us 192x256px images.
