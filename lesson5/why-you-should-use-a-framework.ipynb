We'll use fastai and PyTorch. The benefits of using these libraries is:\n\n- Best practices are handled for you automatically -- fast.ai has done thousands of hours of experiments to figure out what the best settings are for you\n- Less time getting set up, which means more time to try out your new ideas\n- Each idea you try will be less work, because fastai and PyTorch will do the many of the menial bits for you\n- You can always drop down from fastai to PyTorch if you need to customise any part (or drop down from the fastai Application API to the fastai mid or low tier APIs), or even drop down from PyTorch to plain python for deep customisation.\n\nLet's see how that looks in practice.

the time of writing, this submission is well within the top 25% of entries to the competition.\n\n(A lot of submissions to this competition use additional external data, but we have restricted ourselves to just using the data provided. We'd probably do a lot better if we used external data too. Feel free to give that a try, and see how you go. Note that you'll never be able to get to the top of the leaderboard, since a lot of folks in this competition have cheated, by downloading the answers from the internet and uploading them as their submission. In a real competition that's not possible, because the answers aren't public, but there's nothing stopping people from cheating in a tutorial/practice competition like this one. So if you're ready for a real challenge, take a look at the [competitions page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/) and start working on a real competition!)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Final thoughts","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see, using fastai and PyTorch made things much easier than doing it from scratch, but it also hid away a lot of the details. So if you only ever use a framework, you're not going to as fully understand what's going on under the hood. That understanding can be really helpful when it comes to debugging and improving your models. But do use fastai when you're creating models on Kaggle or in \"real life\", because otherwise you're not taking advantage of all the research that's gone into optimising the models for you, and you'll end up spending more time debugging and implementing menial boiler-plate than actually solving the real problem!\n\nIf you found this notebook useful, please remember to click the little up-arrow at the top to upvote it, since I like to know when people have found my work useful, and it helps others find it too.
